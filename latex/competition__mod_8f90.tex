\subsection{Detailed Description}
Central module for all competition scheme-\/related operations. 

Competition between P\+F\+Ts in C\+T\+E\+M is based upon modified L--V equations \cite{Arora2006-pp} \cite{Arora2006-ax}. The L--V equations {\bfseries [lotka1925elements]} \cite{Volterra1926-iz} have been adapted from their initial application for simulating predator--prey interactions in ecosystem models as described below.

Competition parametrization

The change in fractional coverage ( $f$) of a P\+F\+T $\alpha$ through time, $\frac{\mathrm{d}f_\alpha}{\mathrm{d}t}$, is expressed as the result of mortality, and competition and colonization (C\+C) interactions with the other P\+F\+Ts present in a grid cell and bare ground, collectively represented as $B$ where $\alpha \notin B$\+: \[ \label{concepteqn} \frac{\mathrm{d}f_\alpha}{\mathrm{d}t} = g(f_\alpha, f_B) - m_{\alpha} f_\alpha. \]

The C\+C interactions are represented symbolically by the $g(f_\alpha, f_B)$ function. Mortality is assumed to be proportional to the number density of plants and represented by the mortality term, $m_{\alpha} f_\alpha$. The P\+F\+T-\/dependent mortality rate ( $m_{\alpha}$; $day^{-1}$) (described further in Sect. mort\}) produces bare ground via a number of processes, and that bare ground is subsequently available for colonization. We consider the fractional coverage for $N$ P\+F\+Ts plus bare ground ( $f_{N+1}$ = $f_{bare}$) where $\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} f_{j}=1$. For competition between unequal competitors, the P\+F\+Ts are ranked in terms of their dominance. If P\+F\+T $\alpha$ is the most dominant, it will invade the area of other P\+F\+Ts and the bare ground ( $f_B$, $\alpha \notin B$). Woody P\+F\+Ts are all more dominant than grass P\+F\+Ts since trees can successfully invade grasses by overshading them \cite{Siemann2003-jl} and thus are ranked higher. Within tree or grass P\+F\+Ts the dominance rank of a P\+F\+T is calculated based upon its colonization rate ( $c_\alpha$; $day^{-1}$) with higher colonization rates giving a higher dominance ranking. For the general case of P\+F\+T $\alpha$ with a dominance rank of $i$, we describe the ranking from most dominant to least as 1, 2, ${\ldots}$, $i-1$, $i$, $i+1$, ${\ldots}$, $N$. Equation (concepteqn\}) can then be reformulated following a phenomenological approach as

\[ \frac{\mathrm{d}f_\alpha}{\mathrm{d}t} = f^b_\alpha(c_{\alpha, i+1}f_{i+1} +c_{\alpha, i+2}f_{i+2} +\ldots+c_{\alpha,N}f_{N})\nonumber\\ - f_\alpha(c_{1,\alpha}f^b_1 + c_{2,\alpha}f^b_2 + \ldots + c_{(i-1),\alpha}f^b_{i-1})\nonumber\\ - m_{\alpha} f_\alpha,\label{full} \]

where the exponent $b$ is an empirical parameter, which controls the behaviour of the L--V equations. In the original L--V formulation, $b$ is 1, but we modify the L--V relations by using $b = 0$ following \cite{Arora2006-pp} \cite{Arora2006-ax} (implications of this choice are expanded upon below). The fractional cover of P\+F\+T $\alpha$ then changes depending on the gains it makes into the area of less dominant P\+F\+Ts and the losses it suffers due to mortality and encroachment by more dominant P\+F\+Ts. The rate of change of the bare fraction, $f_{bare}$, is expressed as

\[ \label{barecol} \frac{\mathrm{d}f_{bare}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \sum_{\beta=1}^{N}(m_\beta f_\beta - c_{\beta, {bare}}f^b_\beta f_{bare}). \]

The rate at which P\+F\+T $\alpha$ invades another P\+F\+T $\beta$ is given by

\[ \label{coloniz} c_{\alpha,\beta}f^b_\alpha f_{\beta} = c_\alpha\left(\frac{c_{\alpha,\beta}}{c_\alpha} \right)f^b_\alpha f_{\beta} = c_\alpha \delta_{\alpha,\beta} f^b_\alpha f_{\beta}. \]

A P\+F\+T invading bare ground has an unimpeded $\textit{invasion}$ rate, $c_\alpha$. The ratio of the invasion rate by P\+F\+T $\alpha$ into area covered by another P\+F\+T $\beta$ and its unimpeded invasion rate ( $\frac{c_{\alpha,\beta}}{c_\alpha}$) gives the relative efficiency of colonization, termed $\delta_{\alpha,\beta}$, which is a scalar between 0 and 1. $\delta$ is 1 for invasion of any P\+F\+T into bare ground and 1 for tree P\+F\+T invasion into grass P\+F\+Ts. If a P\+F\+T $\beta$ has a lower dominance ranking than another P\+F\+T $\alpha$ then $\delta_{\beta,\alpha}=0$ implying that sub-\/dominant P\+F\+Ts do not invade dominant P\+F\+Ts, but get invaded by them, i.\+e. $\delta_{\alpha,\beta}=1$. Equation (full\}) can then be written more succinctly for each P\+F\+T as

\[ \label{compact} \frac{\mathrm{d}f_\alpha}{\mathrm{d}t} = \sum_{\beta=1}^{N+1} (c_{\alpha} \delta_{\alpha,\beta}f^b_\alpha f_\beta - c_{\beta} \delta_{\beta,\alpha} f_\alpha f^b_\beta) - m_{\alpha} f_\alpha. \]

The value of parameter $b$ is related to the manner in which two P\+F\+Ts interact, represented by $f_{\alpha}^b f_{\beta}$, in Eqs. (full\})--(coloniz\}). As a result, the value of $b$ affects the equilibrium solution for fractional coverage of P\+F\+Ts as well as how $f_i$ evolves over time.

For the usual form of the L--V equations with $b=\delta=1$, and for the case of a grid cell with two P\+F\+Ts, the competition--colonization equations are

\[ \frac{\mathrm{d}f_{1}} {\mathrm{d}t} = c_1 f_1 ( f_2 + f_{bare}) - m_1 f_1 \nonumber \\ = c_1 f_1 ( 1 - f_1) - m_1 f_1, \\ \frac{\mathrm{d}f_{2}} {\mathrm{d}t} = c_2 f_2 f_{bare} - c_1 f_1 f_2 - m_2 f_2 \nonumber \\ = c_2 f_2 (1 - f_1 - f_2) - c_1 f_1 f_2 - m_2 f_2\label{cc_eq_b_eq_1_2}, \]

where the dominant P\+F\+T 1 invades P\+F\+T 2 and the bare fraction, and P\+F\+T 2 invades only the bare fraction. The equilibrium solutions for \$f\+\_\+1\$ and \$f\+\_\+2\$ in this case are

\[ f_1=max \left[ \frac{c_1 - m_1}{c_1}, 0 \right], \vspace*{-4mm} \]

\[ f_2 = max \left[ \frac{c_2 - c_2 f_1 - c_1 f_1 - m_2}{c_2}, 0 \right] \nonumber \\ = max \left[ \frac{(c_2 - m_2)-(1+\frac{c_2}{c_1})(c_1-m_1)}{c_2},0 \right],\label{f2_eq_b_eq_1} \]

In Eq. (f2\+\_\+eq\+\_\+b\+\_\+eq\+\_\+1\}), as long as $(c_1 - m_1)$ $>$ $(c_2 - m_2)$ the equilibrium solution for $f_2$ will always be zero and coexistence is not possible.

For $b=0$ and $\delta=1$, the competition--colonization equations are

\[ \frac{\mathrm{d}f_{1}} {\mathrm{d}t} = c_1 ( f_2 + f_{bare}) - m_1 f_1 \nonumber \\ = c_1 ( 1 - f_1) - m_1 f_1, \\ \frac{\mathrm{d}f_{2}} {\mathrm{d}t} = c_2 f_{bare} - c_1 f_2 - m_2 f_2 \nonumber \\ = c_2 (1 - f_1 - f_2) - c_1 f_2 - m_2 f_2,\label{cc_eq_b_eq_0_1} \]

and the corresponding equilibrium fractions are

\[ \label{f_equil_b_eq_0_1} f_1 = \frac{c_1}{c_1 + m_1}, \vspace*{-4mm} \]

\[ \label{f_equil_b_eq_0_2} f_2 = \frac{c_2(1 - f_1)}{(c_1 + c_2 + m_2)}. \]

In Eqs. (f\+\_\+equil\+\_\+b\+\_\+eq\+\_\+0\+\_\+1\}) and (f\+\_\+equil\+\_\+b\+\_\+eq\+\_\+0\+\_\+2\}), as long as $m_1> 0$ and $c_2 > 0$, then P\+F\+T 2 will always exist and equilibrium coexistence is possible. Values of parameter $b$ between 1 and 0 yield equilibrium values of $f_2$ that vary between 0 (Eq. f2\+\_\+eq\+\_\+b\+\_\+eq\+\_\+1\}) and those obtained using Eq. (f\+\_\+equil\+\_\+b\+\_\+eq\+\_\+0\+\_\+2\}). $b=0$ yields a maximum value of equilibrium $f_2$ allowing P\+F\+T 2 to coexist maximally.

In the standard L--V equations for predator--prey interactions coexistence is possible because the predator depends on prey for its food and so the predator population suffers as the prey population declines. This is in contrast to the application of the equations for competition between P\+F\+Ts where the dominant P\+F\+T does not depend on sub-\/dominant P\+F\+Ts for its existence and is thus able to exclude them completely. The P\+F\+Ts interact with each other through the invasion term $(-c_{\beta} \delta_{\beta,\alpha} f_\alpha f^b_\beta)$ in Eq. (compact\}), where $\delta_{\alpha,\beta} = 1$ or $0$ depending on whether P\+F\+T $\alpha$ can or cannot invade P\+F\+T $\beta$, respectively, as mentioned earlier. This interaction through invasion is represented by $-c_1 f_1 f_2$ in Eq.( cc\+\_\+eq\+\_\+b\+\_\+eq\+\_\+1\+\_\+2\}) (for $b=1$) and by $-c_1 f_2$ in Eq. (cc\+\_\+eq\+\_\+b\+\_\+eq\+\_\+0\+\_\+1\}) (for $b=0$). The magnitude of this interaction thus depends on the value of parameter \$b\$. When \$b=1\$ the interaction is proportional to the product of the fractional coverage of the two P\+F\+Ts ( $f_1 f_2$). When $b=0$, the interaction is proportional to the fractional coverage of the P\+F\+T being invaded ( $f_2$). The use of $b=0$ thus reduces the product term $f_{\alpha}^b f_{\beta}$ to $f_\beta$ and implies that the invasion of sub-\/dominant P\+F\+T $\beta$ does not depend on the current fractional coverage of the dominant P\+F\+T $\alpha$. This case may be thought of as corresponding to the general availability of the seeds of the dominant P\+F\+T $\alpha$ that may germinate and invade the coverage of the sub-\/dominant P\+F\+T $\beta$ provided the climate is favourable, even if P\+F\+T $\alpha$ does not exist in the grid cell, i.\+e. $f_\alpha = 0$ (in the case where $f_\alpha = 0$, the P\+F\+T is always assumed to have a dormant seed bank in the grid cell given the long lifetimes of seeds and their wide dispersion). In contrast, in the standard version of the L--V equations, as implemented for predator--prey interactions, $b$ always equals $1$ since the amount of predation, and hence the reduction in the number of prey, depends on the product of the number of predators and the number of prey. Using $b=0$ is thus consistent with invasion of the sub-\/dominant P\+F\+T $\beta$ being unaffected by the fractional coverage of the dominant P\+F\+T $\alpha$.

Colonization rate

The P\+F\+T-\/dependent colonization rate ( $c_\alpha$; $day^{-1}$) is calculated based on the fraction ( $\Lambda_\alpha$) of positive N\+P\+P ( $kg\,C\,m^{-2}\,day^{-1}$) that is used for spatial expansion

\[ \label{c_a} c_\alpha = {\Lambda_\alpha\, NPP_\alpha\,\xi_{\alpha}}, \]

where $\xi_{\alpha}$ ( $(kg\,C)^{-1}\,m^{2}$) is the inverse sapling density calculated as the reciprocal of vegetation biomass ( $C_{veg,\alpha}$; $kg\,C\,m^{-2}$) multiplied by a P\+F\+T-\/dependent constant ( $S_{sap,\alpha}$; unitless; see Table tab\+:compparams\})

\[ \label{xi} \xi_{\alpha}=\frac{1}{S_{sap,\alpha}\,\max[0.25,\min(5.0, C_{veg,\alpha})]}. \]

The fraction of N\+P\+P used for spatial expansion, $\Lambda_\alpha$, is calculated using the leaf area index ( ${LAI}_\alpha$; $m^2\,leaf\,(m^{2}\,ground)^{-1}$) of a P\+F\+T

\[ \Lambda_{\alpha}=\min(\lambda_{max}, \max (\lambda_{1,\alpha}, \lambda_{2,\alpha})), \vspace*{-4mm} \]

\[ if LAI_\alpha \leq LAI_{min,\alpha}:\nonumber \\ \quad \lambda_{1,\alpha} =0 \nonumber \\ if LAI_{min,\alpha} < LAI_\alpha < LAI_{max,\alpha}:\nonumber \\ \quad \lambda_{1,\alpha} =\frac{LAI_\alpha - LAI_{min,\alpha}} {LAI_{max,\alpha} - LAI_{min,\alpha}} \lambda_{max} \nonumber \\ if LAI_\alpha \geq LAI_{max,\alpha}:\nonumber \\ \quad \lambda_{1,\alpha} =\lambda_{max} \label{lam1} \vspace*{-4mm} \]

\[ if LAI_\alpha > 0.25 LAI_{min,\alpha}:\nonumber \\ \quad \lambda_{2,\alpha} =\cosh(0.115(LAI_\alpha - 0.25 LAI_{min,\alpha})) - 1 \nonumber \\ if LAI_\alpha \leq 0.25 LAI_{min,\alpha}: \nonumber \\ \quad \lambda_{2,\alpha} = 0\label{lam2} \]

The original formulation of \cite{Arora2006-pp} only considered $\lambda_{1,\alpha}$ but here we adjust the parametrization with the addition of $\lambda_{2,\alpha}$, which ensures that a small fraction of N\+P\+P is used for spatial expansion even at very low L\+A\+I values. This additional constraint allows for improved fractional coverage of grasses in arid regions. Similar to $S_{sap,\alpha}$, $LAI_{min,\alpha}$ and $LAI_{max,\alpha}$ are P\+F\+T-\/dependent parameters (see Table tab\+:compparams\}).

The value of $\lambda_{max}$ is set to 0.\+1 so that a maximum of 10\textbackslash{},\{\%\} of daily N\+P\+P can be used for spatial expansion. Finally, $\Lambda_\alpha$ is set to zero for tree P\+F\+Ts when they are in a full leaf-\/out mode and all N\+P\+P is being used for leaf expansion (see Appendix phenol\}).
