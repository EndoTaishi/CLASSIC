\subsection{Detailed Description}
Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (C\+T\+E\+M) Heterotrophic Respiration Subroutine For Bare Fraction. 

Heterotrophic respiration, $R_\mathrm{h}$ ( $mol\,CO_2\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}$), in C\+T\+E\+M is based on respiration from the litter (which includes contributions from the stem, leaf and root components), $R_{h,D}$, and soil carbon, $R_{h,H}$, pools, \[ \label{hetres_all} R_\mathrm{h}=R_{h,D}+R_{h,H}. \]

Heterotrophic respiration is regulated by soil temperature and moisture and is calculated on a daily time step. The original heterotrophic respiration scheme is described in \cite{Arora2003-3b7} while the modified parametrization used in C\+T\+E\+M v. 2.\+0 is detailed in \cite{Melton2014-xy} and is briefly described here. Respiration from the litter and soil carbon pools takes the following basic form \[ R_{\mathrm{h},i} = 2.64 \times 10^{-6}\,\varsigma_i C_i f_{15}(Q_{10}) f(\Psi)_i,\nonumber \\ i = \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{H}.\label{lithet} \]

The soil carbon and litter respiration depends on the amount of carbon in these components ( $C_\mathrm{H}$ and $C_\mathrm{D}$; $kg\,C\,m^{-2}$) and on a P\+F\+T-\/dependent respiration rate specified at $15\,{C}$ ( $\varsigma_\mathrm{H}$ and $\varsigma_\mathrm{D}$; $kg\,C\,(kg\,C)^{-1}\,yr^{-1}$; see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90}). The constant $2.64 \times 10^{-6}$ converts units from $kg\,C\,m^{-2}\,yr^{-1}$ to $mol\,CO_2\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}$.

The effect of soil moisture is accounted for via dependence on soil matric potential ( $f(\Psi)$), described later. The temperature dependency of microbial soil respiration rates has been estimated by several different formulations, ranging from simple $Q_{10}$ (exponential) to Arrhenius-\/type formulations (see review by \cite{Lloyd1994-ct}). In C\+T\+E\+M, soil temperature influences heterotrophic respiration through a temperature-\/dependent $Q_{10}$ function ( $f_{15}(Q_{10})$). The value of $Q_{10}$ itself is assumed to be a function of temperature following a hyperbolic tan function\+: \[ Q_{10} = 1.44 + 0.56\,\tanh[0.075 (46.0 - T_i)], \nonumber\\ i = \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{H}\label{hyper}, \] where $T_{\{D,H\}}$ is the temperature of either the litter or soil carbon pool ( $C$), respectively. The parametrization is a compromise between the temperature-\/independent $Q_{10}$ commonly found in many terrestrial ecosystem models \cite{Cox2001-am} and the temperature-\/dependent $Q_{10}$ of \cite{Kirschbaum1995-db}. While a constant $Q_{10}$ yields an indefinitely increasing respiration rate with increasing temperature, the formulation of \cite{Kirschbaum1995-db} gives a continuously increasing $Q_{10}$ under decreasing temperature, which leads to unreasonably high soil and litter carbon pools at high latitudes in C\+T\+E\+M. The C\+T\+E\+M parametrization avoids these issues with a \$\+Q\+\_\+\{10\}\$ value of about 2.\+0 for temperatures less than $20\,C$, while a decreasing value of $Q_{10}$ at temperatures above $20\,C$ ensures that the respiration rate does not increase indefinitely.

The temperature of the litter pool is a weighted average of the temperature of the top soil layer ( $T_1$) and the root temperature ( $T_\mathrm{R}$) as litter consists of leaf, stem, and root litter ( $T_\mathrm{D} = 0.7 T_1 + 0.3T_\mathrm{R}$). The temperature of the soil carbon pool is calculated as the mean soil temperature in the rooting zone based upon the fraction of roots in each soil layer and their temperature. The carbon in each soil layer is not explicitly tracked but assumed to adopt an exponential distribution \cite{Jobbagy2000-pa}.

The response of heterotrophic respiration to soil moisture is formulated through soil matric potential ( $\Psi$; $MPa$). While soil matric potential values are usually negative, the formulation uses absolute values to allow its logarithm to be taken. Absolute values of soil matric potential are high when soil is dry and low when it is wet. The primary premise of soil moisture control on heterotrophic respiration is that heterotrophic respiration is constrained both when the soils are dry (due to reduced microbial activity) and when they are wet (due to impeded oxygen supply to microbes) with optimum conditions in-\/between. The exception is the respiration from the litter component, which is assumed to be continually exposed to air, and thus never oxygen deprived, even when soil moisture content is high ( $0.04 > \vert \Psi \vert \geq \vert \Psi_{sat} \vert$, where $\Psi_{sat}$ is the soil matric potential at saturation). The soil moisture dependence thus varies between 0 and 1 with matric potential as follows\+:

for $0.04 > \vert\Psi\vert \geq \vert\Psi_{sat}\vert$ \[ f(\Psi)_\mathrm{H} = 1 - 0.5 \frac{\log(0.04)-\log\vert\Psi\vert}{\log(0.04)-\log\vert\Psi_{sat}\vert}\\ f(\Psi)_D = 1\nonumber; \] for $0.06 \geq \vert\Psi\vert \geq 0.04$ \[ f(\Psi)_\{D,H\} = 1; \] for $100.0 \geq \vert\Psi\vert > 0.06$ \[ f(\Psi)_\{D,H\} = 1 - 0.8\frac{\log\vert\Psi\vert-\log(0.06)}{\log(100)-\log(0.06)}; \] for $\vert\Psi\vert > 100.0$ \[ \label{lastpsi} f(\Psi)_\{D,H\}=0.2. \]

Heterotrophic respiration for bare ground is treated separately in C\+T\+E\+M. The carbon contributions to the bare ground litter and soil carbon pools come via processes such as creation of bare ground due to fire, competition between P\+F\+Ts and land use change. The heterotrophic respiration is sensitive to temperature and moisture in the same manner as vegetated areas using Eqs. (lithet\})--(lastpsi\}). The base respiration rates of $\varsigma_{D,bare}$ and $\varsigma_{H,bare}$ are set to $0.5605$ and $0.02258\,kg\,C\,(kg\,C)^{-1}\,yr^{-1}$, respectively.

The amount of humidified litter, which is transferred from the litter to the soil carbon pool ( $C_{\mathrm{D} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}}$) is modelled as a fraction of litter respiration ( $R_{h,D}$) as \[ \label{cdtoh} C_{\mathrm{D} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}} = \chi\,R_{h,D} \] where $\chi$ (see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90}) is the P\+F\+T-\/dependent humification factor and varies between 0.\+4 and 0.\+5. For crops, $\chi$ is set to 0.\+1 to account for reduced transfer of humidified litter to the soil carbon pool which leads to loss in soil carbon when natural vegetation is converted to croplands. Over the bare ground fraction $\chi$ is set to 0.\+45.

With heterotrophic respiration known, net ecosystem productivity ( $NEP$) is calculated as \[ NEP = G_{canopy} - R_\mathrm{m} - R_\mathrm{g} - R_\mathrm{h}. \]

estimate temperature of the litter and soil carbon pools.

over the bare fraction there is no live root. so we make the simplest assumption that litter temperature is same as temperature of the top soil layer.

we estimate the temperature of the soil c pool assuming that soil carbon over the bare fraction is distributed exponentially. note that bare fraction may contain dead roots from different pfts all of which may be distributed differently. for simplicity we do not track each pft\textquotesingle{}s dead root biomass and assume that distribution of soil carbon over the bare fraction can be described by a single parameter.

find moisture scalar for soil c decomposition

this is modelled as function of logarithm of matric potential. we find values for all soil layers, and then find an average value based on fraction of carbon present in each layer.

find moisture scalar for litter decomposition

the difference between moisture scalar for litter and soil c is that the litter decomposition is not constrained by high soil moisture (assuming that litter is always exposed to air). in addition, we use moisture content of the top soil layer as a surrogate for litter moisture content. so we use only psi(i,1) calculated in loops 260 and 270 above.

use temperature of the litter and soil c pools, and their soil moisture scalars to find respiration rates from these pools

first find the q10 response function to scale base respiration rate from 15 c to current temperature, we do litter first
