estimate temperature of the litter and soil carbon pools. litter temperature is weighted average of temperatue of top soil layer (where the stem and leaf litter sits) and root temperature, because litter pool is made of leaf, stem, and root litter.

estimation of soil carbon pool temperature is not straight forward. ideally soil c pool temperature should be set same as root temperature, since soil c profiles are similar to root profiles. but in the event when the roots die then we may run into trouble. so we find the temperature of the soil c pool assuming that soil carbon is exponentially distributed, just like roots. but rather than using the parameter of this exponential profile from our variable root distribution we use fixed vegetation-\/dependent parameters.

find moisture scalar for soil c decomposition

this is modelled as function of logarithm of matric potential. we find values for all soil layers, and then find an average value based on fraction of carbon present in each layer. this makes moisture scalar a function of vegetation type.

find moisture scalar for litter decomposition

the difference between moisture scalar for litter and soil c is that the litter decomposition is not constrained by high soil moisture (assuming that litter is always exposed to air). in addition, we use moisture content of the top soil layer as a surrogate for litter moisture content. so we use only psi(i,1) calculated in loops 260 and 270 above.

use temperature of the litter and soil c pools, and their soil moisture scalars to find respiration rates from these pools

first find the q10 response function to scale base respiration rate from 15 c to current temperature, we do litter first
