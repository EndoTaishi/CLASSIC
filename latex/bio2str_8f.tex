\subsection{Detailed Description}
Biomass To Structural Attributes Conversion Subroutine. 

The time-\/varying biomass in the leaves ( $C_L$), stem ( $C_S$) and root ( $C_R$) components is used to calculate the structural attributes of vegetation for the energy and water balance calculations by C\+L\+A\+S\+S.

Leaf biomass is converted to L\+A\+I using specific leaf area ( ${SLA}$, $m^2\,(kg\,C)^{-1}$), which itself is assumed to be a function of leaf lifespan ( $\tau_L$; see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90})

\[ \label{sla} SLA= \gamma_L\tau_L^{-0.5}\\ LAI = C_LSLA\nonumber \]

where $\gamma_L$ is a constant with value equal to $25\,m^2\,(kg\,C)^{-1}\,yr^{0.5}$. The vegetation height ( $H$; $m$) is calculated for tree, crop and grass P\+F\+Ts as

$ H = \min (10.0C_S^{0.385},45) $ for trees

$ H = (C_S + C_L)^{0.385} $ for crops

$ H = 3.5 (C_{L,g} + 0.55C_{L,b})^{0.5} $ for grasses

where $C_{L,g}$ is the green leaf biomass and $C_{L,b}$ is the brown leaf biomass that is scaled by 0.\+55 to reduce its contribution to the plant height. C\+T\+E\+M explicitly tracks brown leaf mass for grass P\+F\+Ts. The turnover of green grass leaves, due to normal aging or stress from drought and/or cold, does not contribute to litter pool directly as the leaves first turn brown. The brown leaves themselves turnover to litter relatively rapidly $(\tau_{L,b} = 0.1\,\tau_L$).

In peatlands the vegetation height is calculated as (Wu et al. 2016) \cite{Wu2016-zt}

$ H = \min(10.0,3.0C_S^{0.385}) $ for trees

$ H = \min(1.0, 0.25(C_S^{0.2})) $ for shrubs

$ H = = min(1.0,(C_{L,g}+0.55C_{L,b})^{0.3}) $ for grasses and sedges

C\+T\+E\+M dynamically simulates root distribution and depth in soil following (Arora and Boer, 2003) \cite{Arora2003838}. The root distribution takes an exponential form and roots grow and deepen with increasing root biomass. The cumulative root fraction at depth $z$ is given by

$ f_R(z) = 1 - \exp(-\iota z) $

Rooting depth ( $d_R$; $m$), which is defined to be the depth containing $99\,{\%}$ of the root mass, is found by setting $z$ equal to $d_R$ and $f_R = 0.99$, which yields

\[ \label{rootterm1} d_R = \frac{-\ln(1-f_R)}{\iota} = \frac{-\ln(1 - 0.99)}{\iota} = \frac{4.605}{\iota}. \]

The parameter $\iota$ that describes the exponential root distribution is calculated as \[ \label{iota} \iota = \overline{\iota} \left(\frac{\overline{C_R}}{C_R} \right)^{0.8}, \]

where $\overline{\iota}$ represents the P\+F\+T-\/specific mean root distribution profile parameter and $\overline{C_R}$ the average root biomass derived from Jackson et al. (1996) \cite{Jackson1996-va} (see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90}). Equation for $\iota$ above yields a lower (higher) value of $\iota$ than $\overline{\iota}$ when root biomass $C_R$ is higher (lower) than the P\+F\+T-\/specific mean root biomass $\overline{C_R}$, resulting in a deeper (shallower) root profile than the mean root profile.

The rooting depth $d_R$ is checked to ensure it does not exceed the soil depth. If so, $d_R$ is set to the soil depth and $\iota$ is recalculated as $\iota = 4.605/d_R$ (see Eq. rootterm1\} for derivation of 4.\+605 term). The new value of $\iota$ is used to determine the root distribution profile adjusted to the shallower depth. Finally, the root distribution profile is used to calculate fraction of roots in each of the model\textquotesingle{}s soil layers.

class\textquotesingle{} original root parameterization has deeper roots than ctem\textquotesingle{}s default values based on literature. in the coupled model this leads to lower evapotranspiration (et) values. an option is provided here to deepen roots, but this will also increase photosynthesis and vegetation biomass slightly, due to more access to soil water. so while use of deeper roots is desirable in the coupled global model, one may decide to use ctem\textquotesingle{}s default parameterizarion for stand alone simulations, and set deeproots to .false.

------ 1. conversion of leaf biomass into leaf area index -\/------

find specific leaf area (sla, m2/kg) using leaf life span

convert leaf biomass into lai. brown leaves could have less lai than the green leaves for the same leaf mass. for now we assume sla of brown leaves is fracbofg times that of green leaves.

also find stem area index as a function of stem biomass

plant area index is sum of green and brown leaf area indices and stem area index

make class see some minimum pai, otherwise it runs into numerical problems

get fcancmx weighted leaf area index for use by class needle leaf evg + dcd = total needle leaf broad leaf evg + dcd cld + dcd dry = total broad leaf crop c3 + c4 = total crop grass c3 + c4 = total grass also add brown lai. note that although green + brown lai is to be used by class for energy and water balance calculations, stomatal conductance estimated by the photosynthesis subroutine is only based on green lai. that is although both green+brown leaves intercept water and light, only the green portion photosynthesizes. also lump stem and plant area indices for class\textquotesingle{} 4 pfts

for crops and grasses set the minimum lai to a small number, other wise class will never run tsolvc and thus phtsyn and ctem will not be able to grow crops or grasses.

------ 2. conversion of stem biomass into roughness length -\/------

class uses log of roughness length (zoln) as an input parameter. when vegetation grows and dies as per ctem, then zoln is provided by ctem.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item convert stem biomass into vegetation height for trees and crops, and convert leaf biomass into vegetation height for grass
\item convert vegetation height into roughness length \& take its log
\item lump this for ctem\textquotesingle{}s 9 pfts into class\textquotesingle{} 4 pfts

Determine the vegetation height of the peatland shrubs shrubs in mbbog maximum 0.\+3 m average 0.\+18 m (Bubier et al. 2011) grass and herbs avg 0.\+3m, min 0.\+05 max 0.\+8 low shrub avg 0.\+82, min 0.\+10, max 2.\+00 tall shrub avg.\+3.\+76, min 2.\+3, max 5.\+00 (Hopkinson et al. 2005) The Canadian wetland vegetation classification graminoids include grass,rush,reed,sedge forb is all non-\/graminoids herbaceous plants shrubs dwarf $<$0.\+1m, low (0.\+1 to 0.\+5), medium 0.\+5 to 1.\+5, tall $>$1.\+5 trees $>$ 5 m
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

------ 3. estimating fraction of roots in each soil layer for ----- ------ ctem\textquotesingle{}s each vegetation type, using root biomass -----

estimate parameter b of variable root profile parameterization

use b to estimate 99\% rooting depth

if estimated rooting depth is greater than soil depth, or the maximum rooting depth then adjust rooting depth and parameter alpha

also find \char`\"{}a\char`\"{} (parameter determining root profile). this is the \char`\"{}a\char`\"{} which depends on time varying root biomass

using parameter \char`\"{}a\char`\"{} we can find fraction of roots in each soil layer just like class

if rootdepth is shallower than the bottom of current layer and is deeper than bottom of the previous top layer

if rootdepth is shallower than the bottom of 2nd layer

if rootdepth is shallower than the bottom of 3rd layer or even the deeper layer (ignd$>$3)

make sure all fractions (of roots in each layer) add to one.

lump rmatctem(i,9,ignd) into rmatc(i,4,ignd) for use by class

-\/------------------ 4. calculate storage lai -\/-\/------------------

need a minimum slai to be able to grow from scratch. consider this as model seeds.

--- 5. calculate total vegetation biomass for each ctem pft, and -- -\/-\/-\/-\/------------ canopy mass for each class pft -\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/------------

since class uses canopy mass and not total vegetation biomass as an input, we find canopy mass as a sum of stem and leaf mass, for each class pft, i.\+e. only above ground biomass.

if there is no vegetation canopy mass will be abszero. this should essentially mean more bare ground, but since we are not changing fractional coverages at present, we pass a minimum canopy mass to class so that it doesn\textquotesingle{}t run into numerical problems.

--- 6. calculate albedo for class\textquotesingle{} 4 pfts based on specified -\/--- -\/-\/-\/--- albedos of ctem 9 pfts and their fractional coveraes -\/-\/---
