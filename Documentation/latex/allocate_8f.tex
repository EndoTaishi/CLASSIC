\subsection{Detailed Description}
Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (C\+T\+E\+M) Allocation Subroutine. 

Positive N\+P\+P is allocated daily to the leaf, stem and root components, which generally causes their respective biomass to increase, although the biomass may also decrease depending on the autotrophic respiration flux of a component. Negative N\+P\+P generally causes net carbon loss from the components. While C\+T\+E\+M offers the ability to use both specified constant or dynamically calculated allocation fractions for leaves, stems and roots, in practice the dynamic allocation fractions are primarily used. The formulation used in C\+T\+E\+M v. 2.\+0 differs from that for C\+T\+E\+M v. 1.\+0 as described in \cite{Arora2005-6b1} only in the parameter values.

The dynamic allocation to the live plant tissues is based on the light, water and leaf phenological status of vegetation. The preferential allocation of carbon to the different tissue pools is based on three assumptions\+: (i) if soil moisture is limiting, carbon should be preferentially allocated to roots for greater access to water, (ii) if L\+A\+I is low, carbon should be allocated to leaves for enhanced photosynthesis and finally (iii) carbon is allocated to the stem to increase vegetation height and lateral spread of vegetation when the increase in L\+A\+I results in a decrease in light penetration.

The vegetation water status, $W$, is determined as a linear scalar quantity that varies between 0 and 1 for each P\+F\+T and calculated by weighting the degree of soil saturation (\$\{i\}(\{i\})\$, Eq. phitheta\}) with the fraction of roots in each soil layer

\[ \label{degsoilsat} W = \phi_{root} = \sum_{i=1}^g \phi_{i}(\theta_{i}) r_{i}. \]

The light status, $L$, is parametrized as a function of L\+A\+I and nitrogen extinction coefficient, $k_\mathrm{n}$ (P\+F\+T-\/dependent; see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90}), as \[ L = \begin{cases} \exp(-k_\mathrm{n} LAI), \quad trees and crops \\ \max\left(0,1-\frac{LAI}{4.5}\right),\quad grasses. \end{cases} \]

For P\+F\+Ts with a stem component (i.\+e. tree and crop P\+F\+Ts), the fractions of positive N\+P\+P allocated to stem ( $a_{fS}$), leaf ( $a_{fL}$) and root ( $a_{fR}$) components are calculated as \[ \label{As} a_{fS}=\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{S}+\omega_\mathrm{a}(1-L)}{1+\omega_\mathrm{a}(2-L-W)} \vspace*{-4mm} \]

\[ \label{Ar} a_{fR}=\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{R}+ \omega_\mathrm{a}(1-W)}{1+\omega_\mathrm{a}(2-L-W)}, \vspace*{-4mm}\]

\[ \label{Al} a_{fL}=\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{L}}{1+\omega_\mathrm{a}(2-L-W)}= 1-a_{fS}-a_{fR}. \] The base allocation fractions for each component (leaves -- $\epsilon_\mathrm{L}$, stem -- $\epsilon_\mathrm{S}$, and roots -- $\epsilon_\mathrm{R}$) are P\+F\+T-\/dependent (see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90}) and sum to 1, i.\+e. $\epsilon_\mathrm{L} + \epsilon_\mathrm{S} + \epsilon_\mathrm{R} = 1$. The parameter $\omega_\mathrm{a}$, which varies by P\+F\+T (see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90}), determines the sensitivity of the allocation scheme to changes in $W$ and $L$. Larger values of $\omega_\mathrm{a}$ yield higher sensitivity to changes in $L$ and $W$.

Grasses do not have a stem component (i.\+e. $a_{fS}=0$) and the allocation fractions for leaf and root components are given by \[ a_{fL}=\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{L}+\omega_\mathrm{a} L}{1+\omega_\mathrm{a}(1+L-W)},\\ a_{fR}=\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{R}+\omega_\mathrm{a}(1-W)}{1+\omega_\mathrm{a}(1+L-W)}.\]

The above equations ensure that the allocation fractions add up to one ( $a_{fL} + a_{fR} + a_{fS} = 1$).

The dynamic allocation fractions are superseded under three conditions. First, during the leaf onset for crops and deciduous trees, all carbon must be allocated to leaves ( $a_{fL} = 1$, $a_{fS} = a_{fR} = 0$). Second, the proportion of stem plus root biomasses to leaf biomass must satisfy the relationship\+: \[ \label{propwoody} C_\mathrm{S} + C_\mathrm{R} = \eta C_\mathrm{L}^{\kappa},\]

where $C_\mathrm{S}$, $C_\mathrm{R}$ and $C_\mathrm{L}$ are the carbon in the stem, root and leaves, respectively. The parameter $\eta$ is P\+F\+T-\/specific (see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90}) and parameter $\kappa$ has a value of 1.\+6 for trees and crops and 1.\+2 for grasses. Both parameters are based on the Frankfurt Biosphere Model (F\+B\+M) \cite{Ludeke1994-px}. This constraint (Eq. propwoody\}) is based on the physical requirement of sufficient stem and root tissues to support a given leaf biomass. As grasses have no stem component, Eq. (propwoody\}) determines their root to shoot ratio (i.\+e. the ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass). The final condition ensures that a minimum realistic root to shoot ratio is maintained for all P\+F\+Ts ( ${lr}_{min}$, see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90}). Root mass is required for nutrient and water uptake and support for the aboveground biomass. If the minimum root to shoot ratio is not being maintained, carbon is allocated preferentially to roots.

Calculate liquid soil moisture content, and wilting and field capacity soil moisture contents averaged over the root zone. note that while the soil moisture content is same under the entire gcm grid cell, soil moisture averaged over the rooting depth is different for each pft because of different fraction of roots present in each soil layer.

Using liquid soil moisture content together with wilting and field capacity soil moisture contents averaged over the root zone, find soil water status.

Calculate light status as a function of lai and light extinction parameter. for now set nitrogen status equal to 1, which means nitrogen is non-\/limiting.

allocation to roots is determined by min. of water and nitrogen status

now that we know water, light, and nitrogen status we can find allocation fractions for leaves, stem, and root components. note that allocation formulae for grasses are different from those for trees and crops, since there is no stem component in grasses.

if using constant allocation factors then replace the dynamically calculated allocation fractions.

make sure allocation fractions add to one

the allocation fractions calculated above are overridden by two rules.

rule 1 which states that at the time of leaf onset which corresponds to leaf status equal to 1, more c is allocated to leaves so that they can grow asap. in addition when leaf status is \char`\"{}fall/harvest\char`\"{} then nothing is allocated to leaves.

for grasses we use the usual allocation even at leaf onset

rule 2 overrides rule 1 above and makes sure that we do not allow the amount of leaves on trees and crops (i.\+e. pfts 1 to 7) to exceed an amount such that the remaining woody biomass cannot support. if this happens, allocation to leaves is reduced and most npp is allocated to stem and roots, in a proportion based on calculated afrstem and afrroot. for grasses this rule essentially constrains the root\+:shoot ratio, meaning that the model grasses can\textquotesingle{}t have lots of leaves without having a reasonable amount of roots.

make sure that root\+:shoot ratio is at least equal to rtsrmin. if not allocate more to root and decrease allocation to stem.

finally check if all allocation fractions are positive and check again they all add to one.
