The change of internal energy $I_c$ of the vegetation canopy as a result of the phase change processes treated here is calculated as the difference in $I_c$ between the beginning and end of the subroutine\+:

$\Delta I_c = X_i \Delta [C_c T_c ] / \Delta t$

where $C_c$ represents the volumetric heat capacity of the canopy, $T_c$ its temperature, $\Delta t$ the length of the time step, and $X_i$ the fractional coverage of the subarea under consideration relative to the modelled area.

If there is liquid water stored on the canopy and the canopy temperature is less than 0 C, the available energy sink H\+F\+R\+E\+Z is calculated from C\+H\+C\+A\+P and the difference between T\+C\+A\+N and 0 C, and compared with H\+C\+O\+N\+V, calculated as the energy sink required to freeze all of the liquid water on the canopy. If H\+F\+R\+E\+Z $\leq$ H\+C\+O\+N\+V, the amount of water that can be frozen is calculated using the latent heat of melting. The fractional coverages of frozen and liquid water F\+S\+N\+O\+W\+C and F\+R\+A\+I\+N\+C and their masses S\+N\+O\+C\+A\+N and R\+A\+I\+C\+A\+N are adjusted accordingly, T\+C\+A\+N is set to 0 C, and the amount of energy involved is subtracted from the internal energy H\+T\+C\+C and added to H\+M\+F\+C. Otherwise all of the intercepted liquid water is converted to frozen water, and the energy available for cooling the canopy is calculated as H\+C\+O\+O\+L = H\+F\+R\+E\+Z – H\+C\+O\+N\+V. This available energy is applied to decreasing the temperature of the canopy, using the specific heat of the canopy elements, and the amount of energy that was involved in the phase change is subtracted from H\+T\+C\+C and added to H\+M\+F\+C.

If there is frozen water stored on the canopy and the canopy temperature is greater than 0 C, the available energy for melting, H\+M\+E\+L\+T, is calculated from C\+H\+C\+A\+P and the difference between T\+C\+A\+N and 0 C, and compared with H\+C\+O\+N\+V, calculated as the energy required to melt all of the frozen water on the canopy. If H\+M\+E\+L\+T $\leq$ H\+C\+O\+N\+V, the amount of frozen water that can be melted is calculated using the latent heat of melting. The fractional coverages of frozen and liquid water F\+S\+N\+O\+W\+C and F\+R\+A\+I\+N\+C and their masses S\+N\+O\+C\+A\+N and R\+A\+I\+C\+A\+N are adjusted accordingly, T\+C\+A\+N is set to 0 C, and the amount of energy involved is subtracted from H\+T\+C\+C and added to H\+M\+F\+C. Otherwise, all of the intercepted frozen water is converted to liquid water, and the energy available for warming the canopy is calculated as H\+W\+A\+R\+M = H\+M\+E\+L\+T – H\+C\+O\+N\+V. This available energy is applied to increasing the temperature of the canopy, using the specific heats of the canopy elements, and the amount of energy that was involved in the phase change is subtracted from H\+T\+C\+C and added to H\+M\+F\+C.

In the final cleanup, the canopy heat capacity is recomputed and the remaining internal energy calculations are completed.
