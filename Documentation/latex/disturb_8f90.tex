\subsection{Detailed Description}
Update fractional coverages of pfts to take into account the area burnt by fire. Adjust all pools with new densities in their new areas and increase bare fraction. 

And while we are doing this also run a small check to make sure grid averaged quantities do not get messed up. Central module for all disturbance scheme-\/related operations
