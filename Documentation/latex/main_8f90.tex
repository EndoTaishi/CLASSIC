Main model driver for C\+L\+A\+S\+S\+I\+C in stand-\/alone mode using specified boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing. This driver program initializes the run, reads in C\+L\+A\+S\+S input files, manages the run and the coupling between C\+L\+A\+S\+S and C\+T\+E\+M, writes the C\+L\+A\+S\+S sub-\/monthly outputs, and closes the run.
