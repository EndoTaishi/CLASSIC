\subsection{Detailed Description}
Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (C\+T\+E\+M) Maintenance Respiration Subroutine. 

Autotrophic respiration ( $mol\,CO_2\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}$) is composed of maintenance, $R_\mathrm{m}$, and growth respirations, $R_\mathrm{g}$, \[ R_\mathrm{a} =R_\mathrm{m} + R_\mathrm{g}. \] Maintenance respiration accounts for carbon consumed by processes that keep existing plant tissues alive and is a function of environmental stresses. Maintenance respiration is calculated on a half-\/hourly time step (with photosynthesis) for the leaves, $R_{mL}$, and at a daily time step for the stem, $R_{mS}$, and root, $R_{mR}$, components \[ \label{mainres_all} R_\mathrm{m} = R_{mL} + R_{mS} + R_{mR}. \]

Maintenance respiration is generally strongly correlated with nitrogen content \cite{Reich1998-zr} \cite{Ryan1991-ai}. The current version of C\+T\+E\+M does not explicitly track nitrogen in its vegetation components. Therefore, we adopt the approach of \cite{Collatz1991-5bc} \cite{Collatz1992-jf} in which the close relation between maximum catalytic capacity of Rubisco, $V_\mathrm{m}$, and leaf nitrogen content is used as a proxy to estimate leaf maintenance respiration, \[ R_{mL} = \varsigma_\mathrm{L}V_\mathrm{m}\,f_{25}(Q_10d,n)f_{PAR}, \] where $\varsigma_\mathrm{L}$ is set to 0.\+015 and 0.\+025 for $C_3$ and $C_4$ plants, respectively, $f_{PAR}$ scales respiration from the leaf to the canopy level, similar to Eq. (G\+\_\+canopy\}), and the $f_{25}(Q_10d,n)$ function accounts for different temperature sensitivities of leaf respiration during day ( $d$) and night ( $n$). \cite{Pons2003-f26} and \cite{Xu2003-d75} suggest lower temperature sensitivity for leaf respiration during the day compared to night, and therefore we use values of $Q_10d=1.3$ and $Q_10n=2.0$ for day and night, respectively.

Maintenance respiration from the stem and root components is estimated based on P\+F\+T-\/specific base respiration rates ( $\varsigma_\mathrm{S}$ and $\varsigma_\mathrm{R}$ specified at $15\,C$, $kg\,C\,(kg\,C)^{-1}\,yr^{-1}$; see also \hyperlink{ctem__params_8f90}{ctem\+\_\+params.\+f90}) that are modified to account for temperature response following a $Q_{10}$ function. Maintenance respiration from stem and root components, $R_{m\{S,R\}}$, is calculated as \[ \label{r_msr} R_{\mathrm{m},i} = 2.64 \times 10^{-6}\varsigma_{i}l_{\mathrm{v}, i}C_{i}f_{15}(Q_{10}),\quad i = \mathrm{S}, \mathrm{R}, \] where $l_{v,i}$ is the live fraction of stem or root component, i.\+e. the sapwood, and $C_i$ is the stem or root carbon mass ( $kg\,C\,m^{-2}$). The constant $2.64 \times 10^{-6}$ converts units from $kg\,C\,m^{-2}\,yr^{-1}$ to $mol\,CO_2\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}$. The live sapwood fraction, $l_{\mathrm{v},i}$, for stem or root component is calculated following the C\+E\+N\+T\+U\+R\+Y model \cite{Parton1996-zv} as \[ l_{\mathrm{v},i} = \max(0.05, \min[1.0, \exp^{-0.2835 C_i} ]),\quad i = \mathrm{S}, \mathrm{R}. \]

The $Q_{10}$ value used in Eq. (r\+\_\+msr\}) is not assumed to be constant but modelled as a function of temperature following \cite{Tjoelker2001-uz} as \[ Q_{10} = 3.22 - 0.046 \left(\frac{15.0 + T_{\{S,R\}}}{1.9}\right), \] where $T_{\{S,R\}}$ is stem or root temperature ( $C$). Stem temperature is assumed to be the same as air temperature while root temperature is based on the soil temperature weighted by the fraction of roots present in each soil layer \cite{Arora2003838}. The calculated $Q_{10}$ value is additionally constrained to be between 1.\+5 and 4.\+0.

Growth respiration, $R_\mathrm{g}$ ( $mol\,CO_2\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}$), is estimated as a fraction ( $\epsilon_\mathrm{g}=0.15$) of the positive gross canopy photosynthetic rate after maintenance respiration has been accounted for \[ \label{growth_res} R_\mathrm{g}=\epsilon_\mathrm{g}\max[0,(G_{canopy} - R_\mathrm{m})]. \] Finally, net primary productivity ( $NPP$) is calculated as \[ NPP = G_{canopy} - R_\mathrm{m} - R_\mathrm{g}. \]

based on root and stem biomass, find fraction which is live. for stem this would be the sapwood to total wood ratio.

fraction of roots for each vegetation type, for each soil layer, in each grid cell is given by rmatctem (grid cell, veg type, soil layer) which bio2str subroutine calculates. rmatctem can thus be used to find average root temperature for each plant functional type

we assume that stem temperature is same as canopy temperature tcan. using stem and root temperatures we can find their maintenance respirations rates

first find the q10 response function to scale base respiration rate from 15 c to current temperature, we do the stem first.

when finding temperature dependent q10, use temperature which is close to average of actual temperature and the temperature at which base rate is specified

This q10 value is then used with the base rate of respiration (commonly taken at some reference temperature (15 deg c), see Tjoelker et al. 2009 New Phytologist or Atkin et al. 2000 New Phyto for an example.). Long-\/term acclimation to temperature could be occuring see King et al. 2006 Nature S\+O\+M for a possible approach. J\+M.
