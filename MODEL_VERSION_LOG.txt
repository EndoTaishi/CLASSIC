1. 

=========================================
V. 1.2
Jan. 15 2013. JM

Changes from v. 1.1 include:

5. Restart fixes. Previously restarts had a jump in the annual values
this was coming from an uninitialized variable set in RUNCLASSCTEM

4. Instability fix when restarting from snowy ground. CMAI and TSFS were
being set to either 0, in the case of CMAI, or TFREZ in the case of TSFS
when the model was reset with snowy ground. These problems were fixed in 
RUNCLASSCTEM

3. Added in new module to deal with the LUC reading in from .LUC files.
This new module also allows for a seed fraction since the LUC subroutine 
is similar to competition in requiring a seed fraction on each tile in
mosaic mode. This new module also allows the model to be started from 
bare ground in both composite and mosaic modes. (luc_mod.f90) Also this
module brought in using f90 syntax to test how well it would work. Seems
good so could use this to allow sharing of constant parameters between 
modules more simply.

2. PHTSYN renamed to PHTSYN3.

1. Miscellaneous small bug fixes.
