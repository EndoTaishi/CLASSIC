# The Canadian Land Surface Scheme Including biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC)

The Canadian Land Surface Scheme Including biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC) simulates the exchanges of energy, water, carbon, and momentum at the earth's surface. CLASSIC is formed by the coupling of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) and the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM).
