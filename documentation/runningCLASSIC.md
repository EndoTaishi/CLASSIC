# Running CLASSIC for a point location {#runStandAloneMode}


NOTE: Add in for point scale runs. Also include an example of how to turn mortality off.

Just like fire, mortality is also a spatial process. For example, in CTEM approximately 1-2% of trees are killed to account for age related mortality. Clearly, trees in a small plot do not die 1% every year, but on a landscape scale on average 1% of trees may die. So when comparing model simulated biomass to point scale observations it is desirable to switch off mortality. For now, mortality is switched on only when competition is switched on (through the COMPETE switch in the job options file explained next).
