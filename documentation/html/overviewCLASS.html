<div class="textblock"><p>The Canadian Land Surface Scheme, CLASS, was originally developed for use with the Canadian Global Climate Model or GCM (Verseghy, 1991 <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Verseghy1991-635">[85]</a> ; Verseghy et al., 1993 <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Verseghy1993-1ee">[84]</a> ). The table at the end of this overview summarizes the development of CLASS from the late 1980’s onward.</p>
<p>The basic function of CLASS is to integrate the energy and water balances of the land surface forward in time from an initial starting point, making use of atmospheric forcing data to drive the simulation. When CLASS is run in coupled mode with a global or regional atmospheric model, the required forcing data are passed to it at each time step over each modeled grid cell from the atmospheric driver. CLASS then performs its internal calculations, evaluating a suite of prognostic and diagnostic variables such as albedo and surface radiative and turbulent fluxes, which are in turn passed back to the driver. CLASS can also be run in uncoupled or offline mode, using forcing data derived from field measurements, and the output values of its prognostic and diagnostic variables can then be validated against observations.</p>
<p>CLASS models separately the energy and water balances of the soil, snow, and vegetation canopy (see the diagram below). The basic prognostic variables consist of the temperatures and the liquid and frozen moisture contents of the soil layers; the mass, temperature, density, albedo and liquid water content of the snow pack; the temperature of the vegetation canopy and the mass of intercepted rain and snow present on it; the temperature and depth of ponded water on the soil surface; and an empirical vegetation growth index. These variables must be initialized, and a set of physical parameters describing the soil and vegetation existing on the modelled area must be assigned background values, at the beginning of the simulation (see <a class="el" href="basicInputs.html#forcingData">Atmospheric Forcing Data</a>).</p>
<p>At each time step, CLASS calculates the bulk characteristics of the vegetation canopy on the basis of the vegetation types present over the modelled area. In a pre-processing step, each vegetation type is assigned representative values of parameters such as albedo, roughness length, annual maximum and minimum plant area index, rooting depth and so on (see <a class="el" href="basicInputs.html#initProgVar">Initialization of Prognostic Variables</a>). These values are then aggregated over four main vegetation categories identified by CLASS usually: needleleaf trees, broadleaf trees, crops, and grass (i.e. short vegetation). The physiological characteristics of the vegetation in each category are determined at the current time step using the aggregated background parameters and assumed annual or diurnal variation functions. These physiological characteristics are then aggregated to produce the bulk canopy characteristics for the current time step.</p>

Schematic Diagram Of CLASS</div></div>
 In performing the surface flux calculations the modeled area is divided into up to four subareas: bare soil, vegetation over soil, snow over bare soil, and vegetation over snow. The fractional snow coverage is determined using the concept of a threshold snow depth. If the calculated snow depth is less than this value, the snow depth is set to the threshold value and the fractional snow cover is calculated on the basis of conservation of snow mass. The fluxes are calculated for each of the four subareas, and these and the prognostic variables are then areally averaged before being passed back to the atmospheric model.</p>
<p>Originally CLASS performed only one set of these calculations for each grid cell of the model domain. In more recent versions, a “mosaic” option has been added to handle sub-grid scale heterogeneity more effectively. When this option is utilized, each grid cell is divided into a user-specified number of mosaic “tiles”, and the CLASS calculations are performed in turn over each. The surface fluxes are averaged, but the prognostic variables are kept separate for each of the tiles of the mosaic between time steps (see <a class="el" href="compvsmosaic.html">here for more</a>).</p>
<p>In the CLASSIC offline driver, a gather-scatter operation is included in the driver, mimicking the practice in atmospheric models of “gathering” land surface points on latitude circles onto long vectors prior to the calculations (e.g. <a class="el" href="CLASSG_8f.html" title="Gathers variables from two-dimensional arrays (latitude circle x mosaic tiles) onto long vectors for ...">src/CLASSG.f</a> or <a class="el" href="ctemg2_8f.html" title="Performs subsequent &#39;gather&#39; operation on CTEM variables for consistency with physics variables gathe...">src/ctemg2.f</a>), for improved computational efficiency on vector supercomputers. For CLASS, the mosaic tiles on each of the modelled grid cells are “gathered” onto long arrays prior to calling the CLASS subroutines (thus collapsing the first two dimensions of the arrays into one), and subsequently “scattered” back onto the grid cells before performing the diagnostic averaging calculations (e.g. <a class="el" href="CLASSS_8f.html" title="Scatters variables from long, gathered vectors back onto original two-dimensional arrays (latitude ci...">src/CLASSS.f</a> or <a class="el" href="ctems2_8f.html" title="Performs subsequent scatter operation on biogeochemical variables. ">src/ctems2.f</a>).</p>
