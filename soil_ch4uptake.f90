! Convert Tbar to Tsoil (from K to deg C)

! Find the diffusion coefficient in soil (D_soil)

G_T = 1.0 + 0.0055 * Tsoil


thpor_air = thpor - (Tliq + Tice) ! Check if already calc'd in CLASS.

! The bi  (Clapp and Hornberger b-term) is already calculated by CLASS as:
!bi = 15.9 * f_clay + 2.91 thus we use that value.

G_soil = thpor**(4/3) * (thpor_air / thpor)**(1.5 + 3 / bi)

! Next find the term based on soil moisture (suction)

! Find the soil water potential for the uppermost layer
