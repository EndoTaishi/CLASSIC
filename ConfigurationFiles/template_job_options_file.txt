!! EXAMPLES:
!!
!! To set up a transient run that does a cycling of the climate at the start:
!!
!! In the example below the model will run from 1851 - 2012 using a climate dataset that
!! spans 1901 - 2012. The LUC, POPD, CO2 files all span 1850 - 2012. The climate dataset will
!! cycle over 25 years of climate (NUMMETCYLYRS; from 1901 - 1925) twice (CTEMLOOP) for the
!! period 1851 - 1900 while the CO2, POPD, and LUC all run from 1851 - 1900 in their respective
!! files (Each file will search for 1851 at the start so skipping 1850). Once 1901 is hit
!! the MET file no longer cycles and simply runs, like the other input files, until
!! it reaches its end (year 2012).
!!
!! (only the relevant switches are shown below) \n
!! transient_run = .true. \n
!! trans_startyr = 1851 \n
!! CTEMLOOP = 2 ,  <-- note this is set to the number of loops that NUMMETCYLYRS must make to match up with the other datasets. \n
!! NCYEAR = 112 , \n
!! LNDUSEON = .TRUE. , \n
!! CYCLEMET = .TRUE. ,  <-- note this is set to TRUE. \n
!! NUMMETCYLYRS = 25 ,  <-- note this times ctemloop should allow the datasets to match up (e.g. 1850 + 2*25 yrs ends in 1900) \n
!! METCYLYRST = 1901 , \n
!! CO2ON = .TRUE. , \n
!! POPDON = .TRUE. , \n
!! OBSWETF = .false. ,
!!
!! If you are doing methane then this would be true like the CO2 switches
!!
!! ------------------------------
!!
!! If you want a transient run that does not spin over climate at the start, you need to change from above the following:
!!
!! (only the relevant switches are shown below) \n
!! trans_startyr = 2000, <-- whatever year you want to start at \n
!! CYCLEMET = .FALSE. ,  <-- note this is set to FALSE.
!!
! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
!!
!! If you want a transient CO2 run that DOES spin over climate, you need to change from above the following:

!! (only the relevant switches are shown below) \n
!! trans_startyr = 2000, <-- whatever year you want the CO2 to start at (note: the run will end at the end of the CO2 file)\n
!! CO2ON = .TRUE.\n
!! SETCO2CONC = 285.00 , <-- Now ignored.\n
!!
!! ------------------------------
!!
!! To set up a spinup run:
!!
!! This example runs the model over 125 years. The climate cycles from 1901 - 1925 five times. No LUC happens,
!! the POPD is set at the 1850 value read in from the POPD file and the CO2 concentration is fixed at SETCO2CONC.
